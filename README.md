# Heading Decoder
This code is part of the analyses for this [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.25.485865v1), and is used for decoding heading from neural activity.
Make sure you are using Experiment objects from [here](https://github.com/kevinksit/HeadingProject), which are required for this code.

This code was written by Kevin Sit.

## Installation
Clone this repository containing a bunch of small helper functions first: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/kevinksit/GeneralHelperCode).
If necessary clone this repository to preprocess data into the proper Experiment object: [Github Link](https://github.com/kevinksit/HeadingProject).

## Usage
See `decoding_mwe.m` for a minimum working example for processing and decoding recordings.

## Dependencies
